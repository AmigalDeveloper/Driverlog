This is a very early version of this app.

In this app you can manually enter a Log point.
A log point contains
time (date and time)
description
start kilometer
final kilometer
Possible to indicate you have tanked
How much you have thought
and what out has paid per unit
the unit can either be set to Liter (standard) or KWH

The start kilometer will automatically be set to equal the end kilometer of the last trip.

It is possible to see details for a single log point by clicking on it.
It can then be corrected if necessary.

You don't need to be online to use the program as it works like an application on your device.

In this version, it is only possible to save entries on the device on which the program is installed.

It is currently not possible to export, transfer or delete data.


This is released under the GPL license and you are free to try to make improvements to the program
